2. **`2_List_Tuples_Sets_Dictionaries.ipynb`**
   - **Description**: A detailed guide on Python's built-in data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
   - **Key Topics**: Creating and manipulating lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, their use cases, and common methods.

3. **`3_Numpy.ipynb`**
   - **Description**: An introduction to NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
   - **Key Topics**: NumPy arrays, array operations, mathematical functions, and basic data manipulation.

4. **`4_Control_statements.ipynb`**
   - **Description**: Covers control flow statements in Python including loops and conditionals.
   - **Key Topics**: `if`, `else`, `elif` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and `break`/`continue` statements.

5. **`5_Functions.ipynb`**
   - **Description**: An overview of functions in Python, including defining and calling functions, and using function arguments.
   - **Key Topics**: Function definition, return values, default arguments, keyword arguments, and lambda functions.

6. **`6_modules.ipynb`**
   - **Description**: Introduction to Python modules and packages, including how to import and use them.
   - **Key Topics**: Importing modules, creating your own modules, using packages, and understanding Python’s module search path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: You need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don’t have it, you can install it via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrikapeela/python_into_notes.git
   cd python-learning-notebooks
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

   Inside the repository directory, start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open and Explore**

   This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can see and open the notebooks. You can interact with the code cells and run them to see the results.

### How to Use

- **Read and Execute**: Open each notebook and read the explanations. Execute the code cells to see how the examples work.
- **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different inputs to better understand the concepts.
- **Save Your Work**: If you make changes or additions, save the notebooks locally.
